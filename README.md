# Rocuronium-Pharmacokinetics

A simple tool to demonstrate the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of Rocuronium.
It is fully HTML/Javascript based, all dependencies (bootstrap, jquery, chart) are included in the 'adjuncts' directory. To try it out, simply open index.htm with your browser. The buttons are labeled in German, but should still be easy to understand and, if necessary, easy to relabel in the source.

Have fun!
